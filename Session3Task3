script.js
alert("I'm JavaScript!");
alert('Hello') // this line is not having semicolon
alert(`Wor
 ld`)
alert(3 +
1
+ 2); // this is multiple line code and its working


explanation:
first as soon as src sees script.js it will go and executing the instructions defined in script.js file and the first one line has valid syntax so it wont face a problem
and the second line has no problem because ';' is not mandatory to represent a end of line in javascript, and third line works well because '' can be used to represent multiline string
and the fourth alert also wont face a problem because a parameter inside the brackets of a function can be represented in multiple lines
